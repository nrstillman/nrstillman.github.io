# Namid R. Stillman

## General
I am interested in developing interpretable AI methods for scientific research. These methods include approximate inference, geometric learning, deep generative models, and symbolic regression. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to complex and collective systems to derive new rules for living and non-equilibrium systems and integrating these rules into active learning and experiment design.
