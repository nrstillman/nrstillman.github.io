# Namid R. Stillman

My personal homepage, including writings on topics of interest. This is under constant development, and should not be treated as reference material. Note that all writings are my own work and are not constructed using generative models (except my internal one).

## General

I am interested in developing interpretable AI methods for scientific research, with a specific focus on simulation. Broadly, I have worked on topics such as approximate inference, geometric learning, deep generative models, and symbolic regression. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to complex and collective systems to derive new rules for living and non-equilibrium systems and integrating these rules into active learning and experiment design.
